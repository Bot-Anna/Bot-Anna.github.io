## About me

👩‍💻 Hi! I'm a postdoc at the University Hospital of Zurich/University of Zurich in the group of Prof. Dr. Katharina Kusejko.

👩‍🎓 Before my postdoc I did a PhD in mathematics at the University of Basel.

🧬 Now, my work consists of modeling different aspects of the HIV epidemic in Switzerland. I'm passionate about understanding infectious diseases better through modeling.
